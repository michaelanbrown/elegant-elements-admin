# Elegant Elements Admin
## Adding a touch of inspiration and elegance to your every day life

### Description

Elegant Elements started with a passion for mental health. Michaela Brown started this company as a tribute to not only those struggling with every day life, but also to those that promote and pursue a positive lifestyle and good mental health.

The pieces of jewelry behind Elegant Elements are meant to contain postiive words, phrases, and dates of happy memories to encourage each individual as they go about their day.

Once the idea came to life, Michaela decided to expand to all words, phrases, etc. that her clients wanted to put on the jewelry, but she will always hope and strive for positivity and a happy head space for her clients.

Thank you for being a valued member of our team!
